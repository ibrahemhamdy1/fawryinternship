1. Linux Regular files

This type is the most common file type in the Linux file system. regular files contain program instructions human-readable text and ASCII characters.
Some examples of regular files are simple text files PDF files zipped or compressed files binary files or other files like “.png”,”.mp4”, “jpeg”, “.gif”, and many more.

2. Linux Special files

Special files are the files that represent physical devices for any input and output devices like printers, CD drives, keyboards, mice, etc.

3. Linux Directories

directory basically means folder and works just like the folders that are present in the Windows operating system. a directory is a special type of file that stores both regular and special files in a hierarchical order. this hierarchy starts from the root directory which is denoted by a slash (/).

## permissions are used to control who can access and modify files and directories.
	
Read (r) permission allows a user to view the contents of a file or directory.

Write (w) permission allows a user to modify a file or directory.

Execute (x) permission allows a user to run a file or access the contents of a directory.

The best practice is 444



## Ownership In Linux
Ownership:
is used to assign a user and group to a file or directory.

Every file has user and group

Each user has a unique identifier   UID

Each group has a unique identifier GID
