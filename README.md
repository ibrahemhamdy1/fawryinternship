To improve the efficiency and quality of software development, delivery, and deployment, a group of activities and approaches called DevOps combines software development (Dev) with information technology operations (Ops).
### What is DevOps?
DevOps' primary objective is to foster teamwork between the development and operations teams so that they may collaborate easily across the whole software development life cycle. In addition, automation, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment are used to speed up and reduce mistakes in the software development process.

Monitoring and feedback are also emphasized in DevOps, which enables the development and operations teams to see problems early and proactively handle them. Using DevOps methods, businesses may improve their agility, competitiveness, and overall productivity by achieving quicker release cycles, higher-quality software, and enhanced team cooperation.

### Cloud Concept
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
