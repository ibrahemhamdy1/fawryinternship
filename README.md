To improve the efficiency and quality of software development, delivery, and deployment, a group of activities and approaches called DevOps combines software development (Dev) with information technology operations (Ops).
### What is DevOps?
DevOps' primary objective is to foster teamwork between the development and operations teams so that they may collaborate easily across the whole software development life cycle. In addition, automation, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment are used to speed up and reduce mistakes in the software development process.

Monitoring and feedback are also emphasized in DevOps, which enables the development and operations teams to see problems early and proactively handle them. Using DevOps methods, businesses may improve their agility, competitiveness, and overall productivity by achieving quicker release cycles, higher-quality software, and enhanced team cooperation.

### Cloud Concept
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
#### SaaS
Cloud application services are the most well-known of the cloud service models. The software is hosted, packaged, and delivered by a third party through the Internet (typically on a browser-based interface). By delivering the software application over the Internet, enterprises can offload the costs of management and maintenance to the vendor(s).
Popular SaaS options include email and customer relationship management software
#### PaaS
This service layer is primarily geared towards developers and operations professionals. Service providers rent out cloud-based platforms for users to develop and deliver applications. In other words, PaaS provides a framework that makes it easier and more efficient to build, customize, and deploy applications.
#### IaaS
IaaS gives users access to storage, networking, servers, and other computing resources via the cloud. While the user is still responsible for managing their applications, data, middleware, etc., IaaS provides automated and scalable environments that provide a high degree of control and flexibility for the user.
##### For example,
many businesses use IaaS to support workload spikes during busy seasons (like holidays).
Popular IaaS providers include:
>> Amazon Web Services (AWS)
>> Microsoft Azure
>> Google Compute Engine (GCE), the IaaS component of Google Cloud Platform (GCP

### What is DevOps orchestration?
DevOps orchestration tames the complexity of DevOps toolchains by automatically managing workflows and dependencies in DevOps workflows.
DevOps is a widely practiced set of procedures and tools for streamlining the development, release, and updating of software. In their most basic form, DevOps procedures can result in complicated processes, data silos, and fragmented responsibilities.
### Automation versus orchestration
Automation and orchestration are common terms; while closely related, they are distinct concepts.

Automation refers to creating machine-executable processes to perform a task, such as deploying a virtual machine or performing a backup. Organizations may use automation to reduce the likelihood of errors, lighten the workload of staff, and control costs.

Meanwhile, orchestration refers to coordinating the execution of multiple steps in a more complex workflow or pipeline. Orchestration leverages DevOps tools that allow for rapid updates and releases, version control, and other best practices for software engineering.
