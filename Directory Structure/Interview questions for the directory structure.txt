1)What is the significance of the root directory ("/") in Linux?

The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux file system hierarchy. It serves as the parent directory for all other directories and files in the system.

2)Explain the purpose of the /bin, /sbin, and /usr/bin directories.

The /bin directory contains essential binary executable files required for basic system functionality.
The /sbin directory holds system binaries used for system administration tasks.
The /usr/bin directory contains non-essential command-line executables and utilities for regular users.

3)Differentiate between the /etc and /var directories in Linux.

The /etc directory stores system-wide configuration files.
The /var directory holds variable data files, including log files, spool files, and temporary files generated by various processes.

4)What is the purpose of the /home directory?

The /home directory is where individual user directories are located, providing a personal space for each user to store files and configurations.

5)Explain the difference between the /lib and /lib64 directories.

The /lib directory contains libraries (shared objects) required by the system and various applications, typically for 32-bit systems.
The /lib64 directory holds libraries for 64-bit systems.

6)What is the significance of the /dev directory in Linux?

The /dev directory contains special files called device files that represent physical and logical devices on the system.

7)Explain the role of the /tmp directory in Linux and how it differs from /var/tmp.

The /tmp directory is used for storing temporary files created by applications or system processes. Its contents are typically cleared upon system reboot.
The /var/tmp directory also stores temporary files, but its contents persist across reboots.
8) What is the purpose of the /boot directory?

The /boot directory contains files related to the system's boot process, including the kernel, initial RAM disk, boot loader configuration files, and more.

9)Explain the function of the /proc virtual file system.

The /proc directory is a virtual file system that provides information about running processes and system status. It allows direct access to system information and kernel features.

10)How are shared libraries organized in the /usr/lib directory?

Shared libraries (.so files) required by executables located in /usr/bin or other directories are stored in /usr/lib, providing common functions and resources for various applications.

11)What are the typical subdirectories found in the /usr directory, and what do they contain?

The /usr directory contains user-related programs, libraries, and resources. Typical subdirectories include /usr/bin (non-essential binaries), /usr/lib (libraries), /usr/include (header files), and more.

12)What is the difference between the /mnt and /media directories?

The /mnt directory is a general-purpose mount point used for temporarily mounting file systems.
The /media directory serves as a mount point for removable media devices like USB drives, CDs, or DVDs.

13)Why is the /root directory distinct from the /home directory?

The /root directory is the home directory for the root user (system administrator).
The /home directory is where regular user directories are located.

14)What type of files are stored in the /opt directory?

The /opt directory is used for installing additional software packages that are not part of the default system installation. It typically contains third-party applications and their associated files.

15)How would you identify device files in the /dev directory?
Device files in the /dev directory can be identified by their naming convention, which includes a combination of letters and numbers. Block devices often start with "sd" followed by a letter and number, such as /dev/sda or /dev/nvme0n1. Character devices typically start with "tty" followed by a letter and number, such as /dev/tty0 or /dev/ttyUSB0.
