## Introduction

In Linux, a process is an instance of a running program. Understanding how processes work is fundamental to understanding the inner workings of Linux. When a program is executed, the operating system creates one or more processes to execute the instructions in the program.
Each process has its own memory space and set of resources allocated to it by the operating system,
and runs independently of other processes on the system.
